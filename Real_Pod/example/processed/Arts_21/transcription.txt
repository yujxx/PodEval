[0.00-21.76]:  Hey everyone, good evening. Thanks for like tuning into tonight's cinematic talks.
[21.76-27.40]:  I am Alex Martin and we're going to dive into film stuff right so I've got two amazing
[27.40-32.64]:  guests here, Dr. Evelyn Hart and Marcus Shee who are going to like take us on a journey
[32.64-38.44]:  about narratives and emotions and films. So, um, welcome Dr. Hart and Marcus Shee. It's
[38.44-44.28]:  really great to, you know, have you both here? Thanks Alex. It's really nice to be here
[44.28-48.96]:  and like talk about how narratives kind of connect filmmakers with like the audience
[48.96-54.72]:  on this emotional level exciting stuff. Yeah, totally excited Alex. Story telling is
[54.72-59.04]:  like my passion, you know, and I am really looking forward to just diving into all this
[59.04-65.62]:  with you and um, Dr. Hart. So, Dr. Hart, in your work especially like emotions on the
[65.62-72.36]:  silver screen, right? You talk about how narrative structures kind of need to integrate
[72.36-80.20]:  stuff to evoke emotions in viewers. Can you like expand on that? Oh, absolutely Alex,
[80.20-86.32]:  um, a narrative. It's like this, uh, invisible guide for the audience in the book. I talk
[86.32-92.32]:  about, you know, resonance making sure the story beats kind of match with like the viewers
[92.32-98.72]:  own life experiences. It's um, not just about characters on screen. It's about audience
[98.72-106.04]:  reflection, right? That's a super cool. And Marcus, you are known for um, focusing on
[106.04-111.68]:  characters first in screenwriting. How does that like shape the emotional journey? Great
[111.68-118.08]:  question Alex. For me, it's all about pacing the story. So the audience uh, connects with
[118.08-123.20]:  each emotional beat right by like really getting what my characters want and fear. I can craft
[123.20-130.64]:  these moments that just uh, resonate deeply. And Dr. Hart, you've noticed uh, more sophisticated
[130.64-137.20]:  narratives and cinema these days. How do digital platforms and like audience demands
[137.20-143.80]:  play into that? Definitely Alex, digital platforms. They mix up what audiences want, right?
[143.80-149.32]:  I've seen how filmmakers now uh, blend genres and use like nonlinear storytelling to meet
[149.32-154.16]:  these new demands. It's kind of like a mirror of our complex world, you know? Marcus, your
[154.16-159.84]:  stuff reflects um, similar complexity. What do you think about current expectations and how
[159.84-165.52]:  they shape your storytelling? Audiences want narratives that um, really challenge and
[165.52-172.00]:  reflect diverse experiences. This uh, pushes me to like experiment with nonlinear plots,
[172.00-177.68]:  nuance characters and craft stories that you know, resonate deeply. Okay. So you both
[177.68-185.28]:  talked about films with uh, NATO narratives, Dr. Hart. Could you talk more about memento
[185.28-191.84]:  and like its narrative brilliance? Momento is uh, a great example. Christopher Nolan's
[191.84-198.00]:  reverse chronology gets us into the protagonists um, disorientation. This narrative choice,
[198.00-204.16]:  it demands like active viewer engagement, making it superadial. And Marcus, talking about
[204.16-210.56]:  eternal sunshine of the spotless mind. How does it's um, narrative structure boost the
[210.56-217.92]:  emotional connection? That film is just uh, amazing in how it like handles memory and emotion.
[217.92-224.24]:  It's nonlinear structure uh, enhances the turbulent relationships, giving the story like
[224.24-232.16]:  a strong emotional weight. It offers viewers uh, um, emerasic experience. Right so genre can
[232.16-237.52]:  shape a film's emotional journey. Dr. Hart, how do you like approach genre and your narrative
[237.68-243.68]:  analysis? Zane. It sets audience expectations, but also gives filmmakers a kind of blueprint,
[243.68-250.48]:  you know, to either follow or um, disrupt. In my book, I talk about how a narrative can adhere to
[250.48-255.44]:  or creatively mess with these conventions to boost emotional engagement. And Marcus says a
[255.44-260.80]:  screenwriter, how do you handle genre expectations to like? Enhance the audience's emotional
[260.80-267.04]:  experience. For me um, starting with genre expectations is key. Then I uh, look for
[267.12-272.72]:  opportunities to kind of subvert them, making the emotional experience more um, surprising and fulfilling
[272.72-279.28]:  for viewers. It's about finding that right balance to uh, tell a meaningful story. Thank you both
[280.24-285.92]:  for like sharing these insights. It's been an enlightening chat about narratives and how they,
[287.04-292.64]:  evoke emotions. Hope our listeners are um, inspired and all that.
[297.04-303.04]:  Dr. Hart.
[313.04-321.36]:  Oh, it was such a pleasure, Alex. Thanks for having us. Yeah, thanks, Alex. It was um, really great
[321.36-327.76]:  talking stories with you all. Always amazing. All right. And that's uh, it for tonight's cinematic
[327.76-333.12]:  talks tune in next time as we keep exploring. Um, movie magic. Good night everybody.
