[0.00-10.48]:  Good evening, everyone. Welcome to another episode of The Contemporary Canvas. So tonight,
[10.48-17.32]:  we're diving into how art can be a form of social expression. I am Alex Reynolds, and
[17.32-22.40]:  I am here to kind of guide you through this journey into the intersection of art and
[22.40-29.32]:  you know, optimism. So today we've got two really interesting guests with us. We have
[29.32-35.20]:  Sophia Marquez, you know, an artist who's like known for making some waves with her installations
[35.20-41.52]:  that kind of stir up social commentaries. And Dr. Ethan Liu, an art historian who like
[41.52-47.08]:  really dives deep into art movements with his analysis. So thanks for being here, Sophia
[47.08-57.16]:  and Ethan. Yeah, thanks Alex. It's really great to be here and share what I've been like working
[57.16-62.96]:  on with your listeners. Yeah, I appreciate the invite Alex. It's always awesome to kind of chat
[62.96-71.64]:  about the importance of, you know, contemporary art. Um, Sophia, you've described contemporary art as
[71.64-79.00]:  like a mural and megaphone for society. Could you kind of break down that idea for us? Sure, Alex.
[79.00-87.00]:  So what I mean is art kind of reflects what's happening right now and like boosts voices on social
[87.00-93.32]:  issues like stuff like gender inequality or environmental degradation. I'm trying to, you know,
[93.40-102.28]:  provoke emotions and like spark conversation that leads to hopefully action. And you're rising
[102.28-111.48]:  tied peace is about climate change, right? How does it create like that immerseek experience? Yeah,
[112.44-117.72]:  by using real debris from coastlines, I kind of set up a space where people can like feel the
[117.72-124.60]:  effects of sea level rise. It's all about, uh, engaging the senses to make the issue feel, you know,
[124.60-131.56]:  more real than just numbers. Ethan, um, your work on street art. How do you see like it's
[131.56-138.04]:  impact on challenging systemic injustices? Yeah, Alex. Street art is like a really spontaneous and
[138.04-144.52]:  powerful way for artists to connect with communities like folks like Banksy and Shepherd
[144.52-151.24]:  ferry set off, um, immediate conversations on the streets, you know, they kind of intervene
[151.24-158.52]:  directly in social debates. Sophia, you talked about how art might like influence policy. Could you
[160.28-166.12]:  give us an idea of how that's supposed to work? Art, in my opinion, kind of lays the groundwork for
[166.12-172.28]:  change, you know, like one piece might not change laws right away, but it's really all the art
[172.28-178.20]:  together that starts ripples. By keeping social issues in front of people, art can like shift
[178.20-187.40]:  opinions and eventually maybe shape policies. Ah, intersensuality seems to like play a big role
[187.40-196.52]:  in both your views. So, uh, how crucial is this in contemporary art? Yeah, Alex, intersectionality
[196.68-204.12]:  brings like more depth to narratives, artists like, um, Keyhinde Wiley or Kara Walker push us to
[204.12-211.40]:  rethink, you know, race, history and identity. By weaving in all these experiences, art challenges
[211.40-218.28]:  simple views and makes our dialogue richer. Emphun, by blending different identities, like, uh,
[218.28-225.32]:  whether it's race, gender or class, I'm trying to, um, create a complex tapestry of stories.
[225.96-231.64]:  It's like inviting people to think about all the human experiences right. It's this depth
[231.64-238.04]:  that kind of amplifies the impact of art. Uh, so how do you think artists should like engage
[238.04-243.88]:  with the community to make their work more relatable? Yeah, acceptability is like super important.
[243.88-249.24]:  Uh, I work on public projects and use digital platforms to kind of reach more folks. It's about
[249.24-254.52]:  creating a dialogue where art isn't just for galleries, but, uh, it's the streets, the screens,
[254.52-261.00]:  and everyday folks conversations. Right by focusing on engagement, contemporary art should, uh,
[261.00-267.80]:  make sure people can access it easily. Through public installations, social media, um, and educational
[267.80-274.52]:  stuff, artists like Sophia are bringing art to the community, sparking chats and driving change.
[274.52-281.24]:  Yeah, it's um, clear that contemporary art kind of holds a mirror to our world, like pushing us
[281.24-289.48]:  to reflect, talk and act. Thanks, Sophia Marquez and Dr. Ethan Liu for, uh, sharing your thoughts
[289.48-294.60]:  with us tonight. And to everyone listening at home, hope you've been inspired to connect with art
[294.60-300.44]:  around you and, uh, see it as a conversation with our collective conscience until next time.
[301.24-304.84]:  Oh, keep exploring the canvas of our times. Good night.
